In mid January, we stepped out of the kitchen to return to origin.

Executive Chef Daniel Nates, Sous Chef Onan Mendoza, Chef Luis Ruiz — head of Research and Development — and I, Adriana Rose, CEO of Olivea, made the short drive together.

Only ten minutes separate the restaurant from two of the most important seafood producers in our region: <a href="https://jamat.com.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jamat</strong></a> and <a href="https://sargazo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sargazo</strong></a>.

Ten minutes that remind us of something simple and powerful: we are surrounded by the sea.

## Visiting Is Our Responsibility

For us, these visits are not routine. They are instrumental.

Walking through a facility, observing the processes, speaking with the teams, holding the ingredient in your hands completely shifts perspective. It reminds you that flavor does not begin in the kitchen. It begins in the territory.

What we witness in the sea follows the same principle we apply to the land.

Care. Proximity. Responsibility.

At <a href="https://jamat.com.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jamat</strong></a>, I felt movement and intensity — an energy that mirrors the real rhythm of the ocean. There is life. There are hands constantly working. There is character. You can sense that the ingredients come directly from our waters, carrying the strength of the Pacific.

At <a href="https://sargazo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sargazo</strong></a>, I encountered structure and precision. Defined systems, exact temperatures, technical care that communicates deep respect for the product.

Both reflect something essential: commitment to origin.

And that is what we seek.

## The Garden Made Us Accountable

When we began cultivating our own garden, something changed within Olivea.

If we spoke about proximity on land, we had to live it in the sea as well.

If our leaves are born from our soil, our fish must come from our waters.

This is not a trend. It is coherence.

That is why our Research Committee exists. Chef Luis leads it with a clear mission: to verify, to question, and to ensure that every ingredient entering Olivea respects our protocol.

Valle de Guadalupe.  
Ensenada.  
Baja California.  
And Mexico.

Never importing out of convenience.  
Never sacrificing flavor for ease.  
Never losing connection with our territory.

The committee protects our coherence. It protects our identity. It safeguards the dialogue between land and sea.

## When You Sit at Our Table

For me, this is what matters most.

When someone dines at Olivea, they are tasting Baja California. They are tasting our cold Pacific waters. Our salt. Our closeness to the ocean.

Our garden in conversation with the sea. We are ten minutes from the ocean.

And we choose to honor it the same way we honor our land.

Because the sea is also our garden.
