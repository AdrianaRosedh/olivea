In “Mesas de Vida”, published by Baja Flavors and written by Humberto Ballesteros, Ange Joy, founder of Olivea, is portrayed as a voice advocating for a more conscious way of living in Valle de Guadalupe.

The piece reflects on the table as a place of gathering, the garden as origin, and community as essence — highlighting the human-centered vision that Ange brings to Olivea.
