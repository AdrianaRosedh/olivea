      The product leads. The kitchen is born from the garden and from
      nearby producers: clean layers, precise techniques, and cooking
      methods that respect the natural point of each ingredient.

      We do not work with an à la carte menu: the team’s creativity and
      the garden’s availability define each seasonal menu.

    Technique is never the protagonist: it exists to enhance flavor,
    not to distract from it. Stocks, reductions, and ferments are used
    with intention, always in service of balance.

  <Sub id="team" preset="left" className="mt-6">
    The team cooks by reading the climate, the garden, and the service:
    understanding what is at its peak, what is being reserved, and what
    is evolving in the pantry.

  <FieldNote className="mt-6">
    We can adapt the menu for <strong>allergies or dietary restrictions</strong>
    with prior notice. Our approach is technical, precise, and
    product-driven; each adjustment is made while preserving the
    essence of the journey.
