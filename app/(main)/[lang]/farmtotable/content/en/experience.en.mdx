    The Valley gives us land, sea, and farm. We seek balance between acidity
    and richness, bitterness and sweetness, temperature and texture.
    We do not work with a traditional à la carte menu: each experience is
    shaped by what the garden and nearby producers offer at their peak,
    season by season.

  <FieldNote>
    The compost cycle nourishes the beds that nourish the menu. With{" "}
    <strong>prior notice</strong>, we can adapt the journey to important
    allergies or dietary restrictions, as long as they respect the essence
    of the garden.

    Traceability, water stewardship, and circularity guide every decision.
    Sustainability, technique, and responsibility are present throughout the
    experience, conceived as a slow, immersive journey for adults who can
    dedicate two to three hours.
