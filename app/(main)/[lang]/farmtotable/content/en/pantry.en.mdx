        A garden is the essence. But with a garden, what do you create?
      </p>

        Food. And with food, good company. And with good company, experience.

        At Olivea, the garden is the origin — but it is not the only voice.
        Sustainability here is also restraint: cooking with what the territory gives,
        without forcing it.
