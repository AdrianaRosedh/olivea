    Olivea Café is the most relaxed expression of the Olivea ecosystem — where
    mornings unfold slowly, movement stays human, and the garden remains the
    source. It carries the same leaders, the same standards, and the same
    philosophy as Casa Olivea and Olivea Farm To Table.

      Our coffee is sourced exclusively from Mexico. We choose it for balance,
      clarity, and a finish that stays clean — designed to feel calm and unhurried.
      Roasting in-house is part of a future phase, introduced once the system is ready.

      Technique lives quietly here. Espresso is tuned for structure. Filter stays

      feels effortless.

      Ceremonial matcha is prepared with the same care we bring to coffee. We also

      while staying clear and balanced.

      <FieldNote>
        At Olivea, sustainability is efficiency: respect made practical. The café
        shares ingredients, fermentation work, and a continuous return loop with
        Farm To Table — garden → kitchen → compost → back to the soil.

  {/* Bar / forward */}
  <Sub id="bar" preset="fade" className="mt-7 md:mt-8 !min-h-0 !mb-0">
    Olivea Café is calm by design. In the afternoons, we serve a small selection
    of cocktails, wine, and tapas — a soft continuation of the day. Looking forward,
    an evening wine-bar format is being explored, built slowly and intentionally,
    consistent with the Olivea ecosystem.
