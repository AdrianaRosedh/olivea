Olivea is not a hotel.  
It is not a restaurant.  
It is not a café.

It is an ecosystem.

The hotel, the restaurant, and the café are different expressions of the same core — unified by one philosophy.

That unity lives in our logo: an Alebrije.

In Mexican culture, an alebrije is a mythical creature — an imagined being composed of different animals, each carrying meaning. Alone, each part has its own identity. Together, they form something alive.

Our alebrije — our logo — is an insect: an olive as the body, olive leaves as wings, and a radish as the head. Garden, growth, nourishment.

You’ll find the same alebrije across Olivea — in the hotel, the restaurant, and the café — always the same creature, positioned differently. Because Olivea is one living system, experienced from multiple perspectives.

We do not aim for uniformity.  
We aim for coherence.
