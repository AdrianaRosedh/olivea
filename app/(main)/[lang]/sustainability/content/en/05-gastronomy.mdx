A garden is the essence. But with a garden, what do you create?

Food.  
And with food — good company.  
And with good company — experience.

We think of Olivea as a complete gastronomic ecosystem: you stay where your food is grown, and you eat where your food is grown — morning and night.

We often say: our restaurant has a hotel, not the other way around.

Because the table is the center. And the table begins in the soil.

This vision is deeply shared with Chef Daniel Nates.

Daniel is an artist — curious, disciplined, and precise. He knows his craft. He studies, tests, refines. He understands origin and restraint, and he shares our belief that excellence is quiet, exact, and uncompromising.

Ingredients matter here. Storytelling matters. Every dish carries a season, a decision, and a philosophy.

With Daniel, gastronomy becomes dialogue — between garden, kitchen, and guest.
