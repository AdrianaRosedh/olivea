Olivea opened in late summer of 2023.

In the beginning, it was meant to be simple: a calm, easy-to-manage place. A retirement project. Low pressure. Little marketing. No defined brand direction.

But life had other plans.

As the land was worked and the garden began to respond, Olivea started asking for more — not louder, not bigger — just more intention.

From the very beginning, this was a family project.

Ange Joy, the founder, led with design — not just decoration, but how a place breathes, how light settles, how calm is shaped. Her husband, an engineer, gave Olivea its backbone: systems that hold reality, processes that endure, decisions built on feasibility.

Cristina, leading Human Resources, was involved from the start — shaping culture early, before it became visible to guests. Because culture, like soil, must be prepared long before anything meaningful can grow.

Adriana Rose, now CEO, arrived later — and that timing mattered.

Olivea demanded structure. And the family listened.

Different disciplines. One shared responsibility: design, engineering, people, and systems moving together — not to control the project, but to follow where it was clearly going.
