Olivea opened in late summer of 2023.

In the beginning, the project was conceived as something simple:  
a calm, easy-to-operate place.  
A retreat project.  
Low pressure.  
Limited marketing.  
No defined brand vision.

But life had other plans.

As the land was worked and the garden began to respond, it became clear that Olivea was asking for more.  
Not more noise.  
Not more scale.  
But more intention.

From the very beginning, this was a family project.

A family system is also a form of sustainability: distributing responsibility to support the long term.

Not only as a bond,  
but as a way of building: shared decisions, distributed responsibility, and sustained attention over time.

Ange Joy, founder, is a trained designer. From that foundation, she led Olivea through design, as a conscious reading of space: orientation, light, circulation, landscape, and atmosphere in service of calm. Decoration was only the starting point; design became an organizing tool that aligns function with emotional coherence.
In parallel, structure began to take form: systems designed to support everyday reality, processes built to endure, decisions anchored in logic, feasibility, and consistency. Intuition found its support.

From Human Resources, Cristina, a psychologist by training, was involved from the very beginning, shaping internal culture long before it became visible to guests. Because at Olivea, culture, like soil, must be prepared long before anything can bear fruit. Not as discourse, but as living infrastructure: what sustains the team, and therefore the experience.

Adriana Rose, now CEO, arrived later.  
And that timing mattered.

With an MBA, a master’s degree in Computer Science, and an international background, Adriana brought urgency, not the kind that rushes, but the kind that aligns. Vision became direction. Intuition became systems. What had been growing organically began to hold together.

Over time, the project required alignment.  
Not to accelerate, but to bring order.

Different disciplines.  
One shared responsibility.

Design, operations, people, and systems moving together, not to control the project, but to accompany it toward where it was clearly headed.

This is how Olivea came into being:  
not as an individual gesture, but as a living system, attentive, continuously evolving.
