Olivea opened in late summer of 2023.

In the beginning, the project was conceived as something simple:  
a calm, easy-to-operate place.  
A retreat project.  
Low pressure.  
Limited marketing.  
No defined brand vision.

But life had other plans.

As the land was worked and the garden began to respond, it became clear that Olivea was asking for more.  
Not more noise.  
Not more scale.  
But more intention.

From the very beginning, this was a family project.

Not understood solely as a bond, but as a way of building: shared decisions, distributed responsibility, and sustained attention to the long term.

Ange Joy, founder, is a decorator by trade. From that foundation, she led the project through design — not only as decoration, but as spatial intuition. How a place breathes. How light enters. How calm is constructed. Decoration was only the starting point; design became an organizing tool, capable of articulating atmosphere, functionality, and emotional coherence from the outset.

In parallel, structure began to take form. Systems designed to support everyday reality. Processes built to endure. Decisions anchored in logic, feasibility, and consistency. Intuition found its support.

From Human Resources, Cristina, a psychologist by training, was involved from the very beginning, shaping internal culture long before it became visible to guests. Because at Olivea, culture — like soil — must be prepared long before anything can bear fruit. Not as discourse, but as living infrastructure that sustains the team and, with it, the experience.

Over time, the project required alignment.  
Not to accelerate, but to bring order.

Vision found direction.  
Intuition began to systematize.  
What had grown organically started to acquire coherence.

Olivea needed structure.  
And the family listened.

Different disciplines.  
One shared responsibility.

Design, operations, people, and systems moving together — not to control the project, but to accompany it toward where it was clearly headed.

This is how Olivea came into being.  
Not as an individual gesture, but as a living system — attentive, continuously evolving — where every decision is measured against an essential question:

Does this support what we want to last?
